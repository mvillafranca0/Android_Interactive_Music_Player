# MegamanX Interactive Music Player (Final Project)
## Michael Villafranca for CSCI_3314 Mobile App Development: November 2020
### Description:
The creation of this application was intended as an exercise in
developing a free and easily distributable marketing tool to 
showcase an unlreleased project, still under development.
The application itself is designed to function as a template in 
which resources can be easily swapped in and out to market other 
projects. In this case the application is themed after the critically 
acclaimed video game titled "Megaman X," where the user can play pieces 
from the sound track. Functions for interacting with the music include 
pause/play, restart, and put the track on loop. As well as view pre 
recorded gameplay footage while playing a song.
 


This mobile application was developed on Android Studio using Java and XML.
